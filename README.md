### Abstract

Text Style Transfer (TST) rewords a sentence from
one style (e.g. polite) to another (e.g. impolite) while conserving
the meaning and content. This domain has attracted the attention
of many researchers as it makes natural language generation
(NLG) tasks more user-oriented. TST finds its applications widely
in industry such as conversational bots and writing assistance
tools. With the success of deep learning, a plethora of research
works on style transfer based on Machine Learning have been
proposed, developed and tested. This systematic review presents
the past work on Text Style Transfer clustered into categories
based on Machine Learning algorithms. It briefly explains the
various subtasks within Text Style Transfer and assembles its
publicly available datasets. It summarizes the evaluation metrics
used for Style Transfer Tasks and throws light on practical
applications and use-cases of Text Style Transfer. Finally, it
expands on current challenges and points towards promising
future directions for research in TST domain.
